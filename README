# ml_RainfallPredict

Predicting rainfall is a vital aspect of weather forecasting, agriculture planning and water resource management. In this project, it will use linear regression algorithm that help establish relationship between two variables: one dependent (rainfall) and one or more independent variables (temperature, humidity). It tells us how many inches of rainfall we can expect.
